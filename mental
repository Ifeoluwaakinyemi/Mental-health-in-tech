--1. What percentage of tech companies in the table have mental health programs?

SELECT COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tech_mental_health) AS percentage_with_program
FROM tech_mental_health
WHERE has_mental_health_program = true;



--2. Which company has the largest number of employees?

SELECT company_name, employee_count
FROM tech_mental_health
ORDER BY employee_count DESC
LIMIT 1;



--3. Which mental health program type is the most common?

SELECT program_type, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM tech_mental_health
WHERE has_mental_health_program = true
GROUP BY program_type
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 1;



--4. How many companies in the table have stigma reduction efforts as part of their mental health programs?

SELECT COUNT(*) AS count
FROM tech_mental_health
WHERE stigma_reduction_efforts IS NOT NULL;



--5. Which companies have the highest overall satisfaction with their mental health programs (based on employee feedback), and how does this compare to their industry average?

SELECT a.company_name, a.employee_feedback, b.avg_feedback
FROM (
  SELECT company_name, employee_feedback
  FROM tech_mental_health
  WHERE has_mental_health_program = true
) a
JOIN (
  SELECT AVG(employee_feedback) AS avg_feedback, industry
  FROM (
    SELECT employee_feedback, 
      CASE
        WHEN employee_count <= 1000 THEN 'Small'
        WHEN employee_count <= 10000 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'Large'
      END AS industry
    FROM tech_mental_health
    WHERE has_mental_health_program = true
  ) c
  GROUP BY industry
) b ON (
  CASE
    WHEN a.employee_count <= 1000 THEN 'Small'
    WHEN a.employee_count <= 10000 THEN 'Medium'
    ELSE 'Large'
  END = b.industry
)
ORDER BY a.employee_feedback DESC
LIMIT 10;

This query first selects the companies with mental health programs and their corresponding employee feedback scores. It then joins this result with a subquery
that calculates the average employee feedback score by industry (defined by company size), and compares the company's feedback score to the industry average. 
The result is ordered by employee feedback in descending order, and limited to the top 10 companies.



--6. Which mental health program types are most commonly offered together, and which companies offer them?

SELECT a.program_type AS program_type_1, b.program_type AS program_type_2, COUNT(*) AS count, GROUP_CONCAT(c.company_name ORDER BY c.company_name ASC SEPARATOR ', ') AS companies
FROM (
  SELECT program_type, company_name
  FROM tech_mental_health
  WHERE has_mental_health_program = true
) a
JOIN (
  SELECT program_type, company_name
  FROM tech_mental_health
  WHERE has_mental_health_program = true
) b ON a.company_name = b.company_name AND a.program_type < b.program_type
JOIN tech_mental_health c ON a.company_name = c.company_name
GROUP BY a.program_type, b.program_type
ORDER BY count DESC;

This query first selects the program types and companies that offer mental health programs. It then joins this result with itself (aliased as a and b) 
on the company name, but only where the second program type comes after the first alphabetically (to prevent duplicate combinations). Finally, it joins with
the original tech_mental_healthtable (aliased as c) to include the company name in the result. The result is grouped by program type combination and ordered by count
of companies offering that combination, with a comma-separated list of companies.



--7. Which mental health programs are the most effective in reducing stigma, and what is their employee feedback compared to those that do not have stigma reduction efforts?

WITH stigma_reducers AS (
  SELECT company_name, program_type, program_effectiveness, employee_feedback
  FROM tech_mental_health
WHERE has_mental_health_program = true
 AND stigma_reduction_efforts IS NOT NULL
),
non_stigma_reducers AS (
SELECT company_name, program_type, program_effectiveness, employee_feedback
 FROM tech_mental_health
 WHERE has_mental_health_program = true
 AND stigma_reduction_efforts IS NULL
)
SELECT stigma_reducers.program_type, 
AVG(stigma_reducers.employee_feedback) AS avg_feedback_with_stigma_reducers, 
 AVG(non_stigma_reducers.employee_feedback) AS avg_feedback_without_stigma_reducers
FROM stigma_reducers
LEFT JOIN non_stigma_reducers 
ON stigma_reducers.company_name = non_stigma_reducers.company_name 
 AND stigma_reducers.program_type = non_stigma_reducers.program_type
GROUP BY stigma_reducers.program_type
ORDER BY AVG(stigma_reducers.employee_feedback) DESC;

I used a Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to separate mental health programs into those that have stigma reduction efforts and those that do not. i then used joins to
join two CTEs on company name and program type, and calculates the average employee feedback score for each group. The result is grouped by program type and ordered
by the average feedback score of programs that have stigma reduction efforts in descending order.



--8. Which mental health programs are the most effective in accommodating employees with mental health conditions, and what is their employee feedback compared to those that do not have accommodation efforts?

WITH accommodation_effort_providers AS (
 SELECT company_name, program_type, program_effectiveness, employee_feedback
FROM tech_mental_health
WHERE has_mental_health_program = true
AND accommodation_efforts IS NOT NULL
),
non_accommodation_effort_providers AS (
 SELECT company_name, program_type, program_effectiveness, employee_feedback
 FROM tech_mental_health
WHERE has_mental_health_program = true
 AND accommodation_efforts IS NULL
),
highest_accommodation_effectiveness AS (
 SELECT program_type, MAX(program_effectiveness) AS max_effectiveness
FROM accommodation_effort_providers
 GROUP BY program_type
)
 SELECT a.program_type, a.program_effectiveness, 
 AVG(a.employee_feedback) AS avg_feedback_with_accommodation_efforts, 
 AVG(b.employee_feedback) AS avg_feedback_without_accommodation_efforts
FROM accommodation_effort_providers a
 LEFT JOIN non_accommodation_effort_providers b 
ON a.company_name = b.company_name 
AND a.program_type = b.program_type
 JOIN highest_accommodation_effectiveness c 
ON a.program_type = c.program_type AND a.program_effectiveness = c.max_effectiveness
GROUP BY a.program_type, a.program_effectiveness
ORDER BY AVG(a.employee_feedback) DESC;

In this query i also used CTEs to separate mental health programs into those that have accommodation efforts and those that do not. I then joined the two CTEs on
company name and program type, and calculates the average employee feedback score for each group. Additionally, it creates a subquery (aliased as highest_accommodation_effectiveness) 
that calculates the highest program effectiveness score for each program type that has accommodation efforts. The final result only includes programs with the highest effectiveness score for each program type, and is ordered by the average feedback score of programs with accommodation efforts in descending order.
that offer that combination.
