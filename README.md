# Mental-health-in-tech
This SQL project analyzes the relationship between job satisfaction and mental health outcomes among tech employees. By examining survey data from multiple companies, the project aims to identify factors that contribute to positive mental health outcomes in the workplace. 

This is my first SQL project exploring mental health in the tech industry. I created custom tables to store data on company size, mental health program effectiveness,
employee feedback, and more. Through analysis of the data, I hope to gain insights into the state of mental health support in tech and ways to improve it. If you have 
any questions or feedback on the project, please feel free to reach out!
